## Description
MineMancers is an exhilarating free-for-all 2D multiplayer deathmatch game where players assume the roles of mystical minemancers vying to accumulate the most kills within a tight 5-minute round. Each player starts with 100 health points and engages in intense combat to outlast and outplay their opponents.

Key Features:
- Dynamic Combat: Players can attack using two weapons â€” a Pickaxe and a throwable Projectile, each dealing 10 damage. The throwable Projectiles have limited ammunition, encouraging strategic use and frequent resupply.
- Resource Management: Ammunition is scarce and must be mined from gold deposits scattered across the battlefield. Deposits closer to the centre yield more ammo, but disappear temporarily when depleted, adding a layer of strategy to resource collection.
- Defensive Tactics: Players can activate a temporary shield for one second to block incoming projectiles, crucial for surviving in the heat of battle.
- Second Chances: Upon reaching 10 health points or below, players transform into ghosts with enhanced abilities, including double damage output. Ghosts can revive to full health and ammo by securing a kill, offering a dramatic comeback potential.
- Vibrant Visuals and Sound: The game features full animation, engaging music, and immersive sound effects, including the distinct sounds of mining and weapon impacts.

Whether strategizing over resource management or engaging directly in combat, MineMancers promises a fast-paced and engaging multiplayer experience.
